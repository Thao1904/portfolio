        <h1>KUKU’S DAILY ROUTE</h1>
        <p>Kuku’s Daily Route is an interactive game about modern life, fleeting moments, and introspection. Kuku’s life is a tightly scheduled whirlwind of tasks—her days divided into checkpoints she must reach on time. As you navigate her routine, Kuku’s Daily Route serves as a commentary on the pace of modern life and how easily we overlook the emotional value of everyday encounters. By juxtaposing a hurried experience with a reflective journey, the project nudges players to reevaluate their priorities and embrace moments of connection amid the chaos of routine.

            <p>Each task feels like a simple stop: the gym, grabbing a meal, heading to work—but every action either deepens her connections or leaves them shallow. The faster you rush, the less Kuku feels, and the more automated her day becomes.
       
        
            <p>Play seated with a mouse and keyboard or an optional controller.
