        <h1>MeeCommute</h1>
        <p>Mee Commute is a side-scrolling game about chaos, congestion, and the rhythm of daily life. Mee’s world is one of relentless traffic, thick smog, and swirling thoughts. As she rides on a motorbike taxi, you guide her through the tangled streets, clicking to dodge real-time traffic jams and navigating the urban grind.

            <p>The game captures the essence of Saigon’s rush hour—a symphony of honking horns, weaving bikes, and unpredictable obstacles. As you progress, Mee’s inner thoughts unfold, reflecting her daily struggles and hopes amid the city’s chaos.
